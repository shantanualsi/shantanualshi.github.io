Hello World!

I am a software developer based in Singapore. The primary languages I am proficient with are  Java, JavaScript and Python. Along with that, I also work on some scripting on Apache Spark on Hadoop. I am adept at the Unix Terminal and Bash Scripting and a VIM proponent. I am comfortable in working with any databases &#8211; SQL and NoSQL. GIT is the version control of my choice, although I have worked on Perforce, SVN, and CVS.  My interests cross software development boundaries; I possess a fair amount of knowledge in Dev Ops tools like Ansible, Docker, Jenkins, and the Amazon Web Services Stack.

I aspire to be a Professional Software Architect and to be able to design scalable and stable production systems from scratch. Hands-on learning and staying ahead of the curve are two factors that generate a sense of achievement in me. I constantly strive to learn and implement best practices in the technologies I am involved in.

#### A Brief History {#briefhistory}

Computer Science was a no-brainer choice for me I hold a Masters in Computer Science from the much coveted National University of Singapore. I got my Bachelors Degree in Information Technology from Mumbai University, India. Choosing Information Technology provided me the advantage of learning Principles of Communication, Information Theory and Mobile Communication along with Computer Science fundamentals.

#### Professional Experience {#profexp}

Prior to that, I worked on a dataset management portal for a startup. I implemented functionalities for datasets authentication and authorization, and a fully working E-commerce capability for buying datasets on the CKAN platform.
